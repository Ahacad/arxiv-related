- [arxiv bulk access overview](https://info.arxiv.org/help/bulk_data/index.html): get metadata and fulltext in bulks, from like arxiv api, kaggle, aws, and more, very good reference for large scale crawling
- [arxiv Open Archives Initiatives](https://info.arxiv.org/help/oa/index.html): this seems to be old, I don't even know if it is still working
