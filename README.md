- [arxiv bulk access overview](https://info.arxiv.org/help/bulk_data/index.html): get metadata and fulltext in bulks, from like arxiv api, kaggle, aws, and more, very good reference for large scale crawling
- [arxiv Open Archives Initiatives](https://info.arxiv.org/help/oa/index.html): this seems to be old, I don't even know if it is still working
- [arxiv rss help page](https://info.arxiv.org/help/rss.html): since I didn't find any arxiv api on getting latest papers, arxiv rss may be utilized
- [arxiv category taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy): different subject name abrreviations for arxic, get thyself familiar with them!

- [Getting ArXiv Sanity Papers Via RSS](https://den.dev/blog/arxiv-sanity-rss-feeds/): arxiv sanity is cool, but it's TOO MUCH focused on AI, there are a lot more things more than AI in the world! Anyway this seems to be a good article (and GitHub repo), maybe utilized for reference
